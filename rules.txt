I'm only really using this to think about rules in a more abstract manner

Expression = Value (Term|Null)
Value = Number | String | Symbol(() Expression Symbol())
Term = Operator Expression

Declarator = Type Identifier Initializer?
Initializer = VariableInitializer
VariableInitializer = Symbol(=) Expression

Type = Identifier | Keyword(var)
